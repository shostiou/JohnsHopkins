# COURSERA - JOHNS HOPKINS
# MODULE 04 - Exploratory Dataanalysis
## Stephane's assignment for Week 01

### Dataset description
This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. <br>
In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which is available on the course web site: <br>

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site <br>

- Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy <br>
- Time: time in format hh:mm:ss <br>
- Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) <br>
- Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) <br>
- Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) <br>
- Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) <br>
- Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). <br>
- Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. <br>
- Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner. <br>

### Objectives
Here's a good quote from a swirl lesson about exploratory graphs: "They help us find patterns in data and understand its properties. <br>
They suggest modeling strategies and help to debug analyses. We DON'T use exploratory graphs to communicate results."<br>
