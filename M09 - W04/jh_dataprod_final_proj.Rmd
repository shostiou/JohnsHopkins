## Introduction

This document describes the preliminary steps of reflexion related to the definition of a Shiny application for the Johns Hopkins course "building data products" final project.  

## Purpose of the application  

The application which will be defined will be quite simple.  
Using one of the "sand box" dataset available in R, the interface will be focussed on comparing the performances of various regression models.  
For performance & interactivity, the dataset will need to be kept simple (ie. 100 lines max).  

As a standard view, a plot will display the relationship between 2 continuous variables (x vs y).  

Then, the user will be invited to build regression models :  
- linear regression (simple linear regression)  
- polynomial regression + optionnel parameter = "degree of polynom"  

As an option, the user will be invited to display or not the MSE (mean squarred error).  

## Dataset selection  

A qucik Google search for  "sand box regression datasets" drove me to the page : "https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-datasets-in-r/"  
The "abalone dataset" mentioned on the page appeared to be a perfect candidate for me.  
This package comes from a book "Applied Predictive Modeling"

This dataset is used to predict abalone age from abalone measurement data.
The dataset is documented at  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone.  
The predicted variable is "rings" 1 ring = 1 year old.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("AppliedPredictiveModeling")
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
data(abalone)
```

Let's have a look at the content.  

```{r}
head(abalone)
```

```{r}
abalone %>% filter(Height<0.3) %>% ggplot()+
  geom_jitter(mapping=aes(x=Height,y=Rings),alpha=0.1)
```








This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
