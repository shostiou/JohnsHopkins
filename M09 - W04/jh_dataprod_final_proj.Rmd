## Introduction

This document describes the preliminary steps of reflexion related to the definition of a Shiny application for the Johns Hopkins course "building data products" final project.  

## Purpose of the application  

The application which will be defined will be quite simple.  
Using one of the "sand box" dataset available in R, the interface will be focussed on being a companion to EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 

For performance & interactivity, the dataset will need to be kept simple (ie. 100 lines max).  

As a standard view, a plot will display the relationship between 2 variables (x vs y) available in the dataset. The user will be invited which variables shall be selected as "x" and which variable shall be selected as "y" thanks to the selectInput() object in the UI.

A second step, the user will be invited to change the color of the plot with a set o radio buttons radioButtons().  



## Dataset selection  

I decided to use one the pre-loaded data available in R (I used the data() command to get the list of the available datasets). I decided to select the "trees" dataset which shows the relationship between  Diameter, Height and Volume for Black Cherry Trees.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("AppliedPredictiveModeling")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
data(trees)
```

Let's have a look at the content. It's a perfect dataset for our project !

```{r}
str(trees)
```

```{r}
abalone %>% filter(Height<0.3) %>% ggplot()+
  geom_jitter(mapping=aes(x=Height,y=Rings),alpha=0.1)
```








This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
