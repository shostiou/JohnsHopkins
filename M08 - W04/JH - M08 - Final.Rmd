## Project Instructions

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how  much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

The classe variable is encoded as follow :  
Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).



## Project Environment setup

Loading the required packages  
```{r, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(lubridate)
library(utils)
library(tidyr)
```

Collecting training and testing sets

```{r, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# reading the csv files from the links provided in the instructions
training_csv <- download.file('https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv','training.csv')
testing_csv <- download.file('https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv','testing.csv')
# Building training & testing dataframes
training_df <- read.csv('training.csv')
testing_df <- read.csv('testing.csv')

```


## Data Cleaning

Let's start to have a look at the content of the training set

The training set contains `r nrow(training_df)` observations of `r ncol(training_df)` variables.

Using the str command to get a clearer overview of the data contained into the training set.

```{r}
str(training_df)
```

### Dealing with NAs

It appears that a lot variables seem to have NAs.
We need to quantify this in order to select irrelevant variables.  
The code below calculates what is the proportion of NAs for each variable

```{r, warning=FALSE}
training_na_pct <- training_df %>%
  summarise_all(funs(sum(is.na(.)))) %>% mutate_all(funs(./nrow(training_df))) %>% 
  t()
```

We can observe that a significant number of variables contain more than 97% NA values.  
A pragmatic approach will be to ignore those variables.  

```{r}
irrelevant_var <- names(training_na_pct[training_na_pct  > 0.9,])
irrelevant_var
```

There are `r  training_na_pct[training_na_pct  > 0.90,] %>% length() ` variables with a high proportion of NAs (superior to 90% of NAs)

A reasonable approach consists in removing those irrelevant variables.  

```{r}
training_df_01 <- training_df %>% select(-c(all_of(irrelevant_var)))
```


This new training set contains `r nrow(training_df_01)` observations of `r ncol(training_df_01)` variables.

Next step is to identify variables having no content (encoded as "" which corresponds to no value and shall have been encoded as NA)


```{r}
trainin_empty_pct <- training_df_01 %>%
 summarise_all(~sum(.=="")) %>% mutate_all(funs(./nrow(training_df_01))) %>% 
  t()
```



### Dealing with empty values

We can observe that a significant number of variables contain more than 97% "empty" values which shall have been encoded as NAs.  
A pragmatic approach will be to ignore those variables.  


```{r}
irrelevant_var_02 <- names(trainin_empty_pct[trainin_empty_pct  > 0.9,])
irrelevant_var_02
```

There are `r  trainin_empty_pct[trainin_empty_pct  > 0.90,] %>% length() ` variables with a high proportion of empty values (superior to 90% of empty values)

A reasonable approach consists in removing those irrelevant variables.  

```{r}
training_df_02 <- training_df_01 %>% select(-irrelevant_var_02)
```

This new training set contains `r nrow(training_df_02)` observations of `r ncol(training_df_02)` variables.



### Suppressing timestamp, user_name, X variables

If we consider all observations as independent, then timestamp variables will only contribute to introduce bias into our model.   
They need to be removed.  
For the same bias control reason, we will exclude the user_name variable (otherwise, our model will not be able to generalize because it will be linked to a small sample of users appearing into the training set).  
The X variable is just an index. It shall not be taken into account for defining our model.  

```{r}
# variables to be excluded
to_be_excluded <- c('X','user_name','raw_timestamp_part_1','raw_timestamp_part_2','cvtd_timestamp')
# Exclusion
training_df_03 <- training_df_02 %>% select(-to_be_excluded)

```


### Near Zero Variability check  

As introduced into the course, this check will be done thanks to the nearZeroVar function of the Caret package

```{r}
training_df_03 %>% select(-classe) %>% nearZeroVar(.,saveMetrics = TRUE) %>% filter(nzv ==TRUE)
```

The new_window variable can be removed as it has a near zero variability

```{r}
training_df_04 <- training_df_03 %>% select(-new_window) 
```


### Correlation between variables  

The purpose here is to see if some variables are highly correlated in order to reduce the dimension of the model.  


```{r}
M <- training_df_04 %>% select(-classe) %>% cor() %>% abs()
diag(M) <- 0
corr_matrix <- which(M > 0.8,arr.ind=T) %>% as.data.frame()

ggplot(corr_matrix) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=row,y=col)) +
  ggtitle('Highly correlated rows & columns of the correlation matrix')

```

Let's visualize the relationship between 2 of those highly correlated variables  

```{r}
var1 <- corr_matrix$row[20]
var2 <- corr_matrix$col[20]

var1_col <- colnames(training_df_04[var1])
var2_col <- colnames(training_df_04[var2])

var1_col
var2_col


ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=training_df_04[,var1_col] ,y=training_df_04[,var2_col]))+
  xlab(var1_col)+
  ylab(var2_col)


```

On this specific example, we can identify a positive correlation with some outliers.  


So, we can observe that some variables are highly correlated to each other.  
This highlights that dimension reduction techniques shall be applied with the objective of simplifying our model.  

```{r}
PreProcPCA <- training_df_04 %>% select(-classe) %>% preProcess(.,method="pca")
PreProcPCA
```

Principal Components Analysis allow to capture 95% of the variance with only 26 components.
The predict function will be used to build our final training set  

```{r}

training_pca <- training_df_04 %>% select(-classe) %>% predict(PreProcPCA,.)
training_pca$classe <- training_df_04$classe
```


In order to prepare the cross validation, we need to Preprocess the test set like we did with the training set.  
Note that we will consider the "test" csv file as a validation set.


```{r}
validation_df_01 <- testing_df %>% select(-c(all_of(irrelevant_var)))
validation_df_02 <- validation_df_01 %>% select(-irrelevant_var_02)
validation_df_03 <- validation_df_02 %>% select(-to_be_excluded)
validation_df_04 <- validation_df_03 %>% select(-new_window) 

validation_pca <- validation_df_04 %>% select(-problem_id) %>% predict(PreProcPCA,.)
validation_pca$problem_id <- validation_df_04$problem_id

```


## Training of the Model  

The model will have to handle a classification problem (from a set of predictors => predict a "classe" variable).  
Random Forest appear to be one of the best method to be applied.  
Our preprocessed training set (PCA) will be used to build the model.  

### Defining a test set  

The testing set provided with the project instructions will be considered as a validation set.  
In order to be able to perform cross validation, we need to split data contained into the "training" file into a training set and a test set.  

```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(training_pca$classe,p=0.75,list=FALSE)
training_pca_mod <- training_pca[inTrain,]
testing_pca_mod <- training_pca[-inTrain,]

```









corr_matrix %>% as.data.frame() %>% ggplot(corr_matrix)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=row,y=col))

preProcess(log10(spam[,-58]+1),method="pca"






**Background**
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
